\section{Topological data analysis, persistent homology}

This content is a synthesis of this course\cite{INF556} and other
information on the internet.

Motivation: given a point set, find the underlying (homology) structure of
the data. First, let's consider a topological space, how do we determine
the homology structure of the space in a computational way.

\begin{definition}[$p$-simplex ($p\in\N$)]
  Let $V$ be some finite set (the vertices).
  A $p$-simplex $\sigma$ is the convex hull of $p+1$
  points $x_0, \ldots, x_p \in V$.
  We denote $\sigma = \conv\{x_0, \ldots, x_p\}$ a subset of $V$.
\end{definition}
\RM In practice, we simplify a topological space to its homology equivalence (thin
triangulation) without
losing the information we want (connected components, holes).

\begin{definition}[Face]
  A face of $\sigma$ is $\conv(S)$ where $S\subset\{x_0,\ldots, x_p\}$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Simplicial complex]
  A simplicial complex $X$ is a finite collection of simplices s.t.
  $$
  \forall \sigma\in X, \forall \tau\subset\sigma, \tau\in X
  $$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Chain space]
  The vectorial space of $k$-chains of a simplicial complex $X$ over a field $\K$ is defined by:
  $$
  C_k(X) := \left\{\sum_{i=1}^{\left|X_k\right|} \alpha_i \sigma_i: \alpha_i \in \mathbb{K}, \sigma_i \in X_k\right\}
  \simeq \K^{|X_k|}
  $$
  where $X_k = \{A\subset X : |A|=k+1\}$ the set of $k$-simplexes in $X$.
\end{definition}
\RM Let's work with $\K = \Z/2\Z$ so that we don't consider orientation.

\begin{definition}[$p$-chain]
  A $p$-chain is a subset of $p$-simplices in a simplicial complex $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Boundary operator]
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  \partial_k: C_k(X) & \to C_{k-1}(X) \\
  \sigma=\{ v_0, \ldots, v_k \} & \mapsto \sum_{j=0}^k(-1)^j \underbrace{ \{v_0,\ldots,v_k \} \setminus \{v_j\}}_{\in X_{k-1}} \\
  \left(\lambda \sigma+\sigma^{\prime}\right) & \mapsto \lambda \partial_k \sigma+\partial_k \sigma^{\prime} \text{ (linear extension)}
  \end{aligned}
  $$
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  $$
  \forall k, \partial_k \partial_{k+1} = 0
  $$
  \label{lem:pp0}
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}[$k$-th homology group]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $k$-cycles : $Z_k:=\Ker(\partial_k)$
    \item $k$-boundaries : $B_k:=\Im(\partial_{k+1})$
  \end{itemize}
  The $k$-th homology group of $X$ for the field $\K$ is the following quotient
  of vector spaces:
  $$
  H_k(X):={Z_k\over B_k}
  $$
  (well defined because of the Lemma~\ref{lem:pp0})
  The $k$-th Betti number $\beta_k = \mathrm{rank}(H_k)$.
\end{definition}
\RM The computational method is by Gauss elimination, we omit it here
because we later introduce a method to calculate barcodes which is more
powerful and uses Gauss elimination too.

Now, we are able to give the homology structure of a given topological space (simplicial complex).
Let's go back to the beginning, initially, we are only given a point set,
we may link the points in the set to form a simplicial complex.
The way in which we link the points change our view of the underlying structure.
The scale matters Figure~\ref{fig:scale}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{scale.png}
\caption{Structure changes with scale}
\label{fig:scale}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Filtration]
  A filtration over $T$ is a family $\F = (F_t)_{t\in T}$ of increasing topological spaces:
  $$
  \forall t, t^{\prime} \in T, t \leqslant t^{\prime} \Rightarrow F_t \subset F_{t^{\prime}}
  $$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Persistence module]
  Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a given field. A persistence module over $T \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a family $\mathbb{V}=\left(V_t\right)_{t \in T}$ of $\mathbb{K}$-vector spaces
  endowed with linear application $v_t^{t^{\prime}}: V_t \rightarrow V_{t^{\prime}}$ induced by
  a filtration by being applied $H_k$ (e.g.\ Figure~\ref{fig:tda_diagram}).

  $\I_{[l, r)}$(or $\I_{[l, r]}$ etc.) is an interval module with $T = [l, r)$,
  $(V_t)_t = (\K)_t$, $(v^{t'}_t) = (\id)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Decomposition theorem]
  A persistence module $\mathbb{V}$ can be decomposed as a direct sum of interval module
  in the following case (sufficient, not necessary):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $T$ is finite. [Gabriel, 72]
    \item When all the vector spaces $V_t$ are finite-dimensional. [Crowley-Boevey, 2012]
  \end{itemize}
  Furthermore, when it exists, the decomposition is unique (up to isomorphism and ordering of terms).
  See an example at Figure~\ref{fig:tda_diagram}
\end{theorem}

\RM Intuitively, the way to decompose is beginning from where a cycle occurs
and following the linear map until it diminishes and concluding an interval module;
the multiset of pairs of extremities of the intervals obtained by decomposition is called the \textbf{barcodes}
or the persistence diagram; to compute the decomposition, we do Gauss elimination (explain?).

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

\subsection{Algorithm to calculate the persistence diagram}

\paragraph{Input} A simplicial filtration, that is a filtration over a simplicial complex $K$ which verifies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $T=\{1, \ldots, m\}$ (finite, so we have a decomposable filtration).
  \item $K_1=\{\sigma_1\}, K_m = K$
  \item $\forall t \in T, K_t$ is a simplicial complex,
  which is a sub-complex of $K_{t+1}$.
  \item We only add one simplex at each step,
  that is $K_{t+1} \backslash K_t=$ $\left\{\sigma_{t+1}\right\}$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Compute the barcodes corresponding to a simplicial filtration}
  \begin{algorithmic}
  \State M := the matrix of boundray operator $\partial$ =: $(c_0, \ldots, c_m)$
  \State $\mathrm{low}(j):=\left\{\begin{array}{l}\max \left\{i \mid M_{i j} \neq 0\right\} \\ 0 \text { if } M_{i j}=0 \text { for all } i\end{array}\right.$
  \For{$j = 1\ldots m$}
  \While{$\exists i<j$ s.t. $\mathrm{low}(i)=\mathrm{low}(j) \neq 0$}
  \State $c_j \gets c_j+c_i$ (Still working with $\K = \Z/2\Z$)
  \EndWhile
  \EndFor
  \State Barcodes are $\{(i, \max\{j \mid \mathrm{low}(j)=i\}) \mid c_i = 0\}$
  (1. This is a multiset 2. $\max$ return $\infty$ if empty 3. the set where we take max is of size at most 1)
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{proof}[Proof of validity]
Each $c_i = 0$ means the birth of a cycle (one plus for the dimension of the kernel).
Each $c_i \not= 0$ trivialize a cycle (one plus for the dimension of the image).
It remains to show that the pairing is right.

Consider a $c_j \not= 0$, $c_j = e_{l_1} + \cdots + e_{l_k}~(0\le l_1 < \cdots < l_k < j)$.
Note that $\partial_d (\sigma_{l_1} + \cdots + \sigma_{l_k}) = 0$ (Lemma~\ref{lem:pp0}).
So $c_{l_k} = 0$. A posteriori, we can say that $(\sigma_{l_1} + \cdots + \sigma_{l_k})$
this cycle is created at $l_k$ as in a base of $\Ker \partial_d$ (we construct
such base a posteriori in this way).

So the pairing is right.

\end{proof}

\subsection{Stability theorem}

\newcommand{\Dg}{\mathrm{Dg}}

\begin{definition}[Homological critical value]
  Let $X$ be a topological space and $f : X \to \R$ a function.
  A homological critical value of $f$ is a real number $b$ for which
  there exists an integer $k$ such that $\forall \epsilon > 0, $
  $H_k(f^{-1}(-\infty, b-\epsilon]) \to H_k(f^{-1}(-\infty, b])$ is not
  an isomorphism.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Tame]
  A function $f : X \to \R$ is tame if it has a finite number of homological
  critical values and the homological groups $H_k(f^{-1}(-\infty, a])$ are finite-dimensional
  for all $k\in\Z$ and $a\in\R$.
\end{definition}
\RM So that the first condition of the decomposition theorem is satisfied
and we have a finite number of barcodes.

\begin{theorem}[Stability Theorem]
  For any two tame functions $f, g : X \to \R$
  $$
  d_\infty(\Dg~f, \Dg~g) \le \|f-g\|_\infty
  $$
  where
  $$
  d_\infty(\Dg~f, \Dg~g) =
  \inf_{m : \Dg(f)\sqcup \Delta \stackrel{\sim}{\to} \Dg(g)\sqcup \Delta}
  ~~
  \sup_{t\in \Dg(f)\sqcup \Delta} \|t-m(t)\|_\infty
  $$
  and $\Dg$ denotes the persistence diagram.
\end{theorem}

\caption{Barcodes matching on a persistence diagram}
\label{fig:persistence diagram domaine}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
  Let $f, g : X \to \R$ be 2 tame functions. We denote $\varepsilon = \|f-g\|_\infty$.
  We pose $F_t = f^{-1}((-\infty, t]), G_t = g^{-1}((-\infty, t])~(t\in \R)$.

  Key observation: $\left\{F_t\right\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ and $\left\{G_t\right\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$
  are $\varepsilon$-interleaved w.r.t. inclusion:\\
  $$
  \forall t \in \mathbb{R}, G_{t-\varepsilon} \subseteq F_t \subseteq G_{t+\varepsilon}
  $$

  We denote
  $F^{2 \varepsilon}=\left\{F_{2 n \varepsilon}\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$,
  $G^{2 \varepsilon}=\left\{G_{2(n+1) \varepsilon}\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$
  2 discret filtrations.
  $$
  \cdots \subseteq F_0 \subseteq G_{\varepsilon} \subseteq F_{2 \varepsilon} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq G_{(2 n-1) \varepsilon} \subseteq F_{2 n \varepsilon} \subseteq G_{(2 n+1) \varepsilon} \subseteq \cdots
  $$
  We denote another discret filtration $\left\{H_{n \varepsilon}\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$, where $H_{n \varepsilon}=\left\{\begin{array}{l}F_{n \varepsilon} \text { if } n \text { is even } \\ G_{n \varepsilon} \text { if } n \text { is odd }\end{array}\right.$

  $$
  d_\infty(f, g) \le d_\infty(f, F) + d_\infty(F, H) + d_\infty(H, G) + d_\infty(G, g)
  \le (2+1+1+2)\varepsilon \le 6\varepsilon
  $$
  (We can optimise it to $\varepsilon$)
  
\end{proof}

\subsection{Application: essay grading}

Inherently, persistent homology is useful when it comes to 3d modeling.
But in data analysis in general, it is also useful (e.g.\ analyse the
performance of a basketball team and get a intuitive view of the team structure).

Here we use the persistent homology to analyse essays and grading.

Roughly speaking, a better discoursive essay should have a
richer writting structure, (a proposition should be discussed
in different angles, the last paragraph echos to the beginning).
Translated in persistent homology,
if a good essay is a topological space, it should have
many holes (homological groups).

\paragraph{Similarity Filtration with Time Skeleton (SIFTS) \cite{Zhu_2013}}

\begin{definition}[Rips complex]
  Given a symmetric matrix $M \in M_n(R^+)$, we define a filtration of Rips complex
  $$
  (V_d := \{A \subset \llbracket 1, n\rrbracket :
  \forall 1\le i<j\le n, M_{i, j} \le d\})_{d\ge 0}
  $$
\end{definition}

Given an essay, we split it to sentences in order. We embed each sentence by tf-idf.
Then we construct our matrix $M$ by setting $M_{i, j} = 1-\cos(\theta_{i,j})$ where
$\theta_{i, j}$ is the angle between the vectors embedded by the ith and jth sentences.
Then we set $M_{i, i+1}$ (this is where the ``time skeleton'' come from, the reason is
to preserve the order of the essay).

\paragraph{Experiment on a real set of data}

data source (more precisely, the essay set 2, which is discoursive) :

    };
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Number of barcodes increases as grade increases}
\label{fig:ds}
\end{figure}

Those are some discoursive essays on the topic of offense/censorship. We first inspect
an essay with grade 4/6 as an example Figure~\ref{fig:pd}. Then we show
the distribution of number of barcodes of dimension 2 for each grade (1-6)
as well as the average of number of barcodes for each grade (Figure~\ref{fig:ds}).
We find that number of barcodes increases as grade increases.

But there are other factors other than the richness of structure of the essay that may affect
the number of barcodes, like the number of sentences (if we have more points in the set
we will have more chances to form holes) or the number of words.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{gradesah1s.png}
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{gradesah1w.png}
  \caption{The average of barcodes each sentence/word increases as grade increases}
  \label{fig:ads}
\end{figure}

First, let's try to eliminate the effect of number of sentences/number of words
but dividing it (Figure~\ref{fig:ads}). So as we expected, it still shows an simulated
increase of number of barcodes and grade. But even now we may suspect that,
maybe the number of barcodes is just the number of sentences squared. To show that
this is not the case, we fix the number of sentences/the number of words in a range
and inspect the number of barcodes.

\input{ah1tables.tex}

Seeing Figure~\ref{tab:gar}, we indeed observe and confirm the correlation of increase
that we conjectured. However, the correlation is not absolute as we can constate.
This is because we don't have enough data and other factors do affect
too (barcodes only show the structure of an essay, for which we
chose to do the tests on discoursive essays). Typically, the wording
of essays of grade 3 but with 30-40 barcodes is bad and repetitive, which is
probably the reason why they are graded not high.

\paragraph{Further} We may provision studying the identification of type
of arguments by its persistent homology, trying higher dimensional
persistent homology etc. But our journey ends here.
